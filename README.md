# MA3K7-Assignment-1-BV

This repository contains 3 .ipynb files.

The first (MA3K7_Assignment_1_BV_Part_1_(initial_problems)) contains the code that was used partially to solve and to verify the answers obtained to the questions in the original formulation of the problem. This includes the graph that I used as figure 1 in my rubric.

The second (MA3K7_Assignment_1_BV_Part_2_(n_step_recursions) (1)) contains the code that I used to obtain my results for the number of distinct bracelets when the problem is modified to use arbitrary n-step recursions. This includes a function that in theory would be able to obtain the number of distinct bracelets for any n, given enough processing power which would quite quickly not be tractable due to the exponential time complexity of the algorithm.

The third (MA3K7_Assignment_1_BV_Part_3_(base_n)) contains the code that I used to obtain my results for the number of distinct bracelets when using base-n for different values of n. This includes a function that could theoretically compute the number of distinct bracelets for any value of n as well as graphs representing the data.
